# IRIS_Dataset_Classification
A neural network model developed from scratch without any libraries to classify the Iris dataset.
The Dataset was Z-normalized using the StandardScaler object from the module
“sklearn.preprocessing.” Batches, hidden units and epochs were tuned to improve accuracy. 
Model was tested on the test dataset and achieved an accuracy of 93.75%
